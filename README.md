## 🔭 About me
I build websites, make small games/mods, and create tools that help people keep sites online. I love explaining how things work — especially deployment, ID numbers, and maintaining a site so it stays live.

- 🌱 Currently exploring: performance-friendly web hosting, small multiplayer game design, and automations for dev workflows  
- 💬 Ask me about: website deployment, uptime checks, simple game mechanics, and how to keep your site online  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy making things that help other developers learn quickly
